# XIV Loot Tracker

The XIV Loot Tracker is being built to allow teams that track loot distribution to do so with a clean User Interface. It will also allow individuals to track multiple sets of gear.

## Progress
- [x] Ability to get information about gearsets from [Etro](https://etro.gg/).
- [x] Basic display for gearsets.
- [ ] Set up a user login system. This will likely be Discord's OAuth. Note: team pages will be visible to anyone with the link; only those who wish to update information or manage personal gear sets will need to log in.
- [ ] Set up database connection to store user data.
- [ ] Implement team pages.
- [ ] Implement user pages.
